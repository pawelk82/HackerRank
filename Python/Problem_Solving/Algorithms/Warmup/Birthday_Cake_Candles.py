#You are in-charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of her total age. 
#When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. 
#Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.

#For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 3, 2, 1, 3, 
#she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candle is of height 3 and there are 2 such candles.

#Complete the function birthdayCakeCandles that takes your niece's age and an integer array containing height of each candle as input, 
#and return the number of candles she can successfully blow out.

#Input Format

#The first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of candles on the cake.
#The second line contains n space-separated integers, where each integer i describes the height of candle i.

#Output Format

#Print the number of candles that can be blown out on a new line.
