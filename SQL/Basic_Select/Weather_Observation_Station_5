#choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

#Sample Input

#Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY

#Sample Output

#ABC 3
#PQRS 4

SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY limit 1; 
SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY limit 1;
